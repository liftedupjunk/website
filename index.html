                    <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
                    <p class="about-intro"><strong>Lifted Up Junk was built from a simple idea and a lot of determination.</strong></p>

                    <p>In June of 2025, we—a nephew and uncle—came together with the idea of starting a junk removal company. The concept was first sparked by a conversation with a friend from my uncle's gym who owned a similar business. What started as a casual idea quickly turned into something bigger. We began researching the industry, learning how junk removal businesses operate, and figuring out what it would take to build something of our own.</p>

                    <p>Our journey hasn't been a traditional one. We both made the difficult decision to step away from college, choosing a different path forward. For me, that decision meant working restaurant jobs just to get by, while searching for something more stable and meaningful. Starting Lifted Up Junk became a turning point—a chance to build a future through hard work, consistency, and ownership.</p>

                    <p>In November of 2025, we officially launched Lifted Up Junk and went live with our website. While we're still in the early stages and working toward our first clients, we're fully committed to building this company the right way—one job, one customer, and one lesson at a time.</p>

                    <p>Today, I handle the day-to-day operations as the person in the truck—managing appointments, showing up on-site, and making sure each job is done efficiently and professionally. My uncle serves as a mentor and guide, helping shape the business and offering support as we navigate the challenges of entrepreneurship together.</p>

                    <p class="about-tagline"><strong>Lifted Up Junk is more than just junk removal.</strong> It represents a fresh start, hard-earned growth, and the belief that with commitment and effort, you can lift yourself up and build something meaningful. We're excited for what's ahead and look forward to serving our community with honest work and reliable service.</p>
